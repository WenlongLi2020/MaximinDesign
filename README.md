# MaximinDesign
This is the R-package: MaximinDesignï¼Œwhich provides a method of constructing maximin distance designs.

Details of the method can be found in Wenlong Li, Min-Qian Liu and Boxin Tang (2021). A method of constructing maximin distance designs. Biometrika, published online. doi:10.1093/biomet/asaa089

Important reminder: Before you first run our R codes, please install Matlab soft and find a folder called Matlab in folder man in R package MaximinDesign in GitHub, and then put this folder to local disk (D:).

The MaximinD is the basic function using the direct replacement method. Applying this function MaximinD, we provide easy-to-use functions called MaximinDSeqDel, Prop1, Prop2 and Prop3, where MaximinDSeqDel allows a design with flexible columns to be constructed.

It has been tested on Windows.
